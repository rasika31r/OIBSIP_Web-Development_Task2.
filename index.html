      Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the “Missile Man of India,” was a scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India. He was born on <strong>15 October 1931</strong> in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played a vital role in India’s space and defense programs, especially at DRDO and ISRO, where he helped launch SLV-III and worked on the Agni and Prithvi missiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As President (2002–2007), he was loved for his humility, dedication to youth, and inspirational speeches. His books, especially <em>"Wings of Fire"</em>, continue to inspire generations.
